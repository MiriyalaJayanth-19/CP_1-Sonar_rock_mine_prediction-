# CP_1-Sonar_rock_mine_prediction-
Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a sonar signal is reflected from a Mine (M) or a Rock (R) using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset contains 60 frequency-based features extracted from sonar signals.
The goal is to build and evaluate classification models that can distinguish between the two classes with high accuracy.
